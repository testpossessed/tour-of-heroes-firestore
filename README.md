# Tour Of Heroes Firestore

This project is an implementation of the Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial that uses Firestore to store and retrieve data.

The changes are primarly in app.module.ts where AngularFire has been imported and configured and in hero.service.ts which was changed to use AngularFirestore.  I added two methods to complete the CRUD operations, but have left it to you to update the UI to use these methods for adding and deleting Heroes.
